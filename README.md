# Sun-Tracking-Solar-System
Created an efficient solar energy harvesting system with dual-axis sun tracking capability that automatically adjusts solar panel orientation to maximize energy collection throughout the day. The system uses light sensors and servo motors to follow the sun's path, increasing energy output by up to 40% compared to fixed panels.
